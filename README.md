In this knowledge check I was asked to create a page using and html doctype. With this page I was to use bootstrap concepts to formate and style the page.
I made a navigation bar and made it responsive across all size screens, for smaller screens it collapses into a hamburger menu.
I did this by utilizing bootstrap commands using container-fluid class and navbar-toggler with a button type.

After that i contructed a registration form using a container wit a vertical padding of 5. I centered the heading using a margin bottom-4 and text-center command.
I constucted my rows and collumns and using classes like form-label and form control with the command required when an input is required.
Below the form i made a checkbox for agreement to terms using the class form-check, form-check-input and form-check-label commands. 

I created a submit button that stretches across the screen by using the class btn btn-success w-100 which also styled the button green.

I was then asked to create a responsive table to simulate submissions.
I used an hr class and gave it a vertical margin of 5 to put some space between the submit button and the table.
Using the table-responcive class i styled the table using the table stripped to make it easier to view, table hover to highlight which row you are hovering over,
made a border for the table and aligned it to the middle.
For the table heading I used the th scope=col and th scope=row commands, for the last collumn for the status I created badges that
indicate if the submission was recieved or rejected using span class= badge bg-success for recieved which turns it green or span class=badge bg-danger which turns it red.

Next i placed two responsive images both in separate div class container-fluid. 
The top image is styled with a black border with the command class img-fluid to ensure its proportionate to the table above.
The second image is styled round by using the class rounded-circle.

Finally at the bottom of the page their are two buttons one button is styled blue by using the primary command and btn-lg to make it large,
this button can be viewed across all screen sizes.
The second button is styled green by using the successs command and using the btn-sm d-none d-md-inline commands making it a small button
only visible on larger screens keeping it inline with the first button.

This project had some challanges mostly with the navbar and getting the hamburger menu to open, after trial and error I managed to figure it out.
I really ejoyed this project and I learned a lot from it.
